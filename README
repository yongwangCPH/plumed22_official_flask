* support for POSIX library dirent.h
* xxd (present in most unix distributions)

Suggested software (libraries are checked during configure and enabled if available):
* optimized blas and lapack libraries, can be replaced by an internal version if not available
* MPI library to run parallel simulations
* VMD molfile plugins (www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins) to read arbitrary file formats,
  can be replaced by an internal version supporting a few formats if not available
* matheval library (www.gnu.org/software/libmatheval) to use algebraic collective variables
* doxygen (www.doxygen.org) to build user manual
* latex to build the user manual - used by doxygen
* graphviz (www.graphviz.org) to show class hierarchy in developer manual - used by doxygen

Quick compilation instructions:
* configure for your system:
> ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
* if necessary, edit Makefile.conf
* configure your environment
> source ./sourceme.sh
* compile plumed
> make
* the "plumed" executable should be now in the path
> plumed help
* compile the manuals
> make doc

The starting point for user documentation is
user-doc/html/index.html

The starting point for developer documentation is
developer-doc/html/index.html

* To install plumed in $HOME/opt (set during configure):
> umask 022
> make install
* A sample modulefile with environment variable will be placed in
$HOME/opt/lib/plumed/src/lib/modulefile
* Path to installed documentation can be found with command
> plumed info --user-doc


GIT VERSION

Several branches and tags are stored on the git repository.

Branches named v2.X correspond to release branches.

Master branch may contain non tested features and is not expected to be used by non-developers.
It is typically containing features that will be available on the next release.

Tags named v2.XbY correspond to beta releases - use with care
Tags named v2.X.Y correspond to official releases - use the latest available.

To report problems found on beta or official releases, use the normal plumed-users
mailing list. Just state exactly which version you are using.

To report problems found on master branch, use the plumed2-git mailing list.
This is also the correct place for discussions about new features etc.
When reporting please provide the git hash (get it with "git rev-parse HEAD").
